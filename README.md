# DS-Implementations

### Each C program here demonstrates an application of a DataStructure with its implementation.

**1. AVL Tree**
 
 AVL Tree is a height balanced binary search tree.

**2. Binary search tree**

Binary Search Tree is a node based binary tree data structure in which the left subtree of a node is lesser than the parent node and right subtree of a node is greater than the parent node.

**3. Breadth first search(BFS)**

BFS is used for searching in a tree or graph data structure which is here implemented using stacks and recursion. Each recursive calls is traced using stacks.

**4. Depth first search(DFS)**

DFS is used for traversing/searching in a tree or graph data structure which is implemented here using Queues.

**5. Hashing**

Hashing is a technique to store or map large data records inato smaller tables using hashing techniques. Division method is used here as hashing function to obtain hash values for data records and linear probing is used to resolve collisions in hash table (DS used: array).

**6. Infix to Postfix expression**

We have used stack to convert infix expression(a+b) to postfix expression(ab+). 

**7. Pattern matching**

Pattern matching is done to find given patterns (DS used: string).

**8. Postfix evaluation**

Evaluating a postfix expression using stacks.

**9. Process scheduler**

Scheduling processes in CPU with the help of priority queue.

**10. Red-black tree**

Red-Black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which each node contains an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black.

**11. Union & intersection in linked list**

Demonstrates Union and Intersection of Linked Lists.
